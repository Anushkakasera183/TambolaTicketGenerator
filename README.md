Tambola Ticket Rules
Grid Structure: A Tambola ticket consists of a 3-row × 9-column grid (total 27 cells).

Number Placement:

Each row must have exactly 5 numbers (leaving 4 blank spaces randomly).

The numbers must be sorted in ascending order within a row.

Column-wise Number Distribution:

Column 1 (1st column) → Numbers from 1-9

Column 2 → Numbers from 10-19

Column 3 → Numbers from 20-29

Column 4 → Numbers from 30-39

Column 5 → Numbers from 40-49

Column 6 → Numbers from 50-59

Column 7 → Numbers from 60-69

Column 8 → Numbers from 70-79

Column 9 (last column) → Numbers from 80-90

Uniqueness: A ticket cannot have duplicate numbers.

Random Distribution: The placement of blank spaces and numbers should be randomized while following the above constraints.


How would you design an algorithm to generate a valid Tambola (Housie) ticket while ensuring randomness, correct number placement, and adherence to the standard rules?
